# RomanUrduEmbeddings

When working with roman-Urdu one of the main difficulty faced by people is that they can't use many off-the-shelf tools for roman-Urdu so In this repository, I show how can we create word embeddings using some raw roman-Urdu text.

This is just to show how it can be done but for better results, it's recommended you acquire more data (scrapping is probably the way to go).

special thanks to Hamza Khan for the partial data.

## Todo

Better pre-proccessing to avoid data loss.
